# Hellênikê / ἑλληνική : interactive language practice


> Interactive notebooks for practice with material introduced in the [Hellênikê textbook](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/).

In F22, these will be hosted at `shot.holycross.edu/hellenike` (*not yet available*).


## Contents of the repository

The `pluto` directory hosts [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks.  The easiest way to run all of them locally is to use PlutoSliderServer.  From a Julia terminal in this directory:

```julia
using PlutoSliderServer
PlutoSliderServer.run_git_repository(joinpath(pwd(), "pluto"))
```

You can of course also open any individual notebook directly in a locally running Pluto if you prefer.  

> *Note that links in the* `index.jl` *notebook are for use with PlutoSliderServer only*.
